# Parkinson-s-disease-detection

# About: 
This is my final project from the Data Science Academy at Brainster, where I collaborated with a team to develop a machine learning model for detecting early signs of Parkinson's disease. The project was executed using Google Colab.

|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| XGBoost | 0.90113        | 0.9011          | 0.90111  | 0.90113      | 0.89904       | 0.89902        | 0.89903 | 0.89904     |




# Conclusion

The model demonstrated accurate predictions using the keystroke logger we developed. While there is always potential for improvement, given the extensive dataset and the limited time available for model preparation and training, this represents the best outcome we could achieve under the circumstances.
